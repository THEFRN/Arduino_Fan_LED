# Controlling fan and LED on Arduino Through wifi (IOT)

## What do we need?

* Arduino Board
* Fan
* LED
* Power Suply

> we have used an arduino board so we could connect a fan and a LED on it
we did the wiring, all that was needed is the proggram.
>>we have used "esp8266WebServer.h", "WiFiClient.h" and "ESP8266WiFi.h" libraries.
connecting your phone, PC or etc... and the arduino board to a wifi (both must connect to the same wifi) you should be able to controll fan and LED.
